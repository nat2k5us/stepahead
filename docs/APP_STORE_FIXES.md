# App Store Submission - High Risk Issues to Fix

## Critical Issues Found by Pre-Submission Test

### 1. Privacy Policy URL (REQUIRED) ⚠️ HIGH RISK

**Status:** Missing
**Impact:** App will be rejected without this

**What to do:**

1. **Update privacy.html with StepAhead branding:**
   - Currently says "iSpeakClear" - needs to be changed to "StepAhead"
   - Update app name throughout the document
   - Update developer/company name if needed

2. **Host the privacy policy:**
   - Option A: Use Firebase Hosting (recommended for StepAhead)
     ```bash
     firebase init hosting
     # Select your project: stepahead-519b0
     # Public directory: privacy-site
     # Configure as single-page app: No
     firebase deploy --only hosting
     ```
   - Option B: Use GitHub Pages
   - Option C: Host on your own domain

3. **Add URL to Info.plist:**
   ```xml
   <key>NSPrivacyPolicyURL</key>
   <string>https://stepahead-519b0.web.app/privacy.html</string>
   ```

4. **Add to App Store Connect:**
   - When submitting app, add Privacy Policy URL in App Information section

### 2. Native Functionality (4.2 Guideline) ⚠️ HIGH RISK

**Status:** App uses primarily web technologies
**Impact:** May be rejected as "just a web view"

**What you have (GOOD):**
- ✅ Native speech recognition integration
- ✅ Native microphone access
- ✅ iOS-specific permissions

**Recommended improvements:**
1. **Emphasize native features in App Store description:**
   - Highlight speech recognition capabilities
   - Mention native iOS integration
   - Focus on accessibility features

2. **Add more native features (if time permits):**
   - Native notifications for task reminders
   - iOS Share Extension for sharing tasks
   - Widgets for quick task access
   - Haptic feedback for task completion

3. **Update App Store metadata to emphasize:**
   - "Native iOS speech recognition"
   - "Optimized for iPhone and iPad"
   - "Accessibility-first design"

### 3. Firebase API Key Security ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK

**Status:** API key visible in source code
**Impact:** Potential security issue (but normal for Firebase)

**What to know:**
- Firebase API keys are safe to include in client code
- They identify your Firebase project, not authenticate users
- Security is enforced by Firebase Security Rules

**Recommended action:**
1. **Enable Firebase App Check:**
   ```bash
   # In Firebase Console:
   # 1. Go to Project Settings > App Check
   # 2. Register your iOS app
   # 3. Enable App Check
   ```

2. **Set up Firestore Security Rules:**
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // For production, use authentication-based rules:
       match /users/{userId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
       match /tasks/{taskId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Need Help?

If you get stuck on any of these issues, the most critical one is **Privacy Policy URL**. Without it, your app will be automatically rejected.

Focus on:
1. Privacy Policy URL (MUST HAVE)
2. Native features in description (HIGH PRIORITY)
3. Security rules (IMPORTANT)
