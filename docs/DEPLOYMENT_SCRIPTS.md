## First-Time Setup

If this is your first deployment, follow the complete guide:

ðŸ“– **[DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md](./DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md)**

This guide covers:
1. Registering App ID in Apple Developer Portal
2. Creating app in App Store Connect
3. Setting up certificates and provisioning profiles
4. Configuring app metadata
5. Preparing screenshots and assets
6. First TestFlight build
7. Submitting for App Store review

## Configuration Files

### Bundle ID & Team ID
- **Bundle ID**: `com.speechtherapy.app`
- **Team ID**: `RMMLMVNZ3L`
- **App Name**: Speech Trainer

These are configured in:
- `ios/App/App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `ios/App/exportOptions.plist`
- `ios/App/exportOptionsAppStore.plist`
- `capacitor.config.json`

### Signing Configuration
Located in Xcode project:
- Open: `open ios/App/App.xcworkspace`
- Go to: App target â†’ Signing & Capabilities
- Method: Automatic signing (recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "No signing identity"
```bash
# Solution 1: Sign in to Xcode
# Xcode â†’ Settings â†’ Accounts â†’ Add Apple ID

# Solution 2: Reset derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
```

### "Failed to upload to App Store Connect"
```bash
# Check your Apple ID credentials
xcrun altool --validate-app --type ios --file path/to/App.ipa \
  --username "your@email.com" --password "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD"
```

### Simulator not showing app
```bash
# Restart simulator
xcrun simctl shutdown all
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro Max"
./sync-web-to-ios.sh
```

### Web changes not reflecting in app
```bash
# Force clean and rebuild
rm -rf www
rm -rf ios/App/App/public
./sync-web-to-ios.sh
```

## Workflow Example

### Development Cycle
```bash
# 1. Make changes to index.html
vim index.html

# 2. Test on simulator
./sync-web-to-ios.sh

# 3. Iterate until satisfied
# ... repeat steps 1-2 ...

# 4. Commit changes
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push
```

### Release Cycle
```bash
# 1. Verify setup
./verify-setup.sh

# 2. Test on simulator
./sync-web-to-ios.sh

# 3. Upload to TestFlight for beta testing
./publish-testflight.sh

# 4. Get feedback from testers
# ... wait for feedback ...

# 5. Make fixes if needed
# ... repeat steps 1-3 ...

# 6. Submit to App Store
./publish-appstore.sh

# 7. Complete submission in App Store Connect
# - Add release notes
# - Submit for review
# - Wait for approval (typically 1-3 days)
```

## Version Management

### Incrementing Version Number
Before each release, update the version in Xcode:

1. Open project: `open ios/App/App.xcworkspace`
2. Select App target
3. Go to General tab
4. Update:
   - **Version**: 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0, etc. (public-facing)
   - **Build**: 1, 2, 3, etc. (increments with each upload)

Or via command line:
```bash
# Update version
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleShortVersionString 1.1.0" ios/App/App/Info.plist

# Update build number
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleVersion 2" ios/App/App/Info.plist
```
