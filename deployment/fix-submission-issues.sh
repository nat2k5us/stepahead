# Export Compliance for App Store Submission

## What is Export Compliance?

U.S. law requires disclosure of apps that use, access, implement, or incorporate encryption. This applies to most apps that use HTTPS.

---

## iSpeakClear Export Compliance Answers

### Question: "Does your app use encryption?"

**Answer: YES**

*But only standard HTTPS encryption.*

---

### Question: "Does your app use encryption other than what's provided by Apple?"

**Answer: NO**

**Explanation:**
- We only use standard HTTPS for network communication
- Speech recognition uses Apple's native APIs (no custom encryption)
- Firebase uses standard SSL/TLS encryption
- No proprietary or custom encryption algorithms

---

### Question: "Is your app designed for use by the military?"

**Answer: NO**

**Explanation:**
- iSpeakClear is a consumer speech improvement app
- Educational and health/wellness purposes only
- Not designed or marketed for military use

---

### Question: "Does your app use encryption that's exempt from export compliance?"

**Answer: YES - Exempt**

**Exemption Category:**
**(e)(3) - HTTPS/TLS for communication with servers**

**Justification:**
- Uses only standard HTTPS encryption
- No custom cryptographic functionality
- Falls under publicly available encryption exemption

---

## Required Documentation

### App Store Connect Form

When submitting, you'll answer these questions in App Store Connect:

1. **Uses Encryption:** Yes
2. **Encryption Type:** Standard HTTPS/TLS only
3. **Export Compliance:** Exempt (Category (e)(3))
4. **ERN Number:** Not required (exempt)

### No Additional Paperwork Needed

Because iSpeakClear uses only standard HTTPS:
- ✅ No ERN (Encryption Registration Number) required
- ✅ No CCATS (Commodity Classification) required
- ✅ No annual reports required
- ✅ Automatically exempt

---

## Common Questions

### "What if Apple asks for documentation?"

**Rare, but if requested, provide this:**

**Email Response:**
```
Subject: Export Compliance - iSpeakClear

Dear App Review Team,

iSpeakClear uses encryption solely for standard HTTPS communication with Firebase servers.

Specifically:
- HTTPS/TLS for API calls (provided by iOS URLSession)
- Firebase Authentication (standard SSL/TLS)
- No proprietary or custom encryption algorithms
- No encryption beyond what Apple provides in iOS

This falls under export exemption category (e)(3) - publicly available encryption for communication with servers.

No ERN or CCATS documentation is required for this exemption.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### "Do I need a lawyer?"

**No.** Standard HTTPS usage is straightforward and exempt. Legal review is only needed if you:
- Implement custom encryption algorithms
- Use encryption for data-at-rest
- Target military/government users
- Export to embargoed countries

---

## Summary

✅ **iSpeakClear is export compliant**
✅ **Uses only standard HTTPS encryption**
✅ **Exempt from additional documentation**
✅ **No ERN or special paperwork required**

**Just answer the App Store Connect questions honestly and select the HTTPS exemption.**

- ❌ User-to-user communication
- ❌ Location sharing with others
- ❌ Adult content
- ❌ Simulated gambling

---

## Justification for 4+ Rating

### Why 4+ is appropriate:

1. **Educational Purpose:** Speech therapy and reading improvement
2. **No Inappropriate Content:** Clean, safe content for all ages
3. **Supervised Use:** While rated 4+, young children should use with parent/therapist
4. **Privacy Protected:** No user data exposed to other users

### Content Features:
✅ Educational stories (age-appropriate)
✅ Positive reinforcement
✅ No advertisements
✅ No in-app purchases (premium features disabled)
✅ Safe, controlled environment

---

## Alternative Ratings Considered

### 9+
**Not necessary because:**
- Content is simpler than 9+ threshold

- Suitable for younger children with supervision

### 12+
**Not applicable:**
- No mature themes
- No suggestive content
- No mild profanity

### 17+
**Not applicable:**

- No unrestricted features
- Family-friendly app

---

## Parental Guidance Notes

**For App Description (optional):**

> *While iSpeakClear is rated 4+, we recommend parental or therapist guidance for children under 7. The app is designed as a therapeutic tool and works best when used as part of a structured learning program.*

---

## Special Considerations

### COPPA Compliance (Children Under 13)

If marketing to children under 13:
- ✅ No personal information collected without parental consent
- ✅ Privacy policy addresses children's data
- ✅ No behavioral advertising
- ✅ Parental controls available

**iSpeakClear is COPPA compliant** with current implementation.

---

### International Ratings

**PEGI (Europe):** Likely PEGI 3 or PEGI 7
**ESRB (North America):** Likely E (Everyone)
**ACB (Australia):** Likely G (General)

---

## Ratings Maintenance

**Review age rating if you add:**
- User-to-user messaging → May require 12+ or 17+
- Web browsing → May require 17+
- User-generated content sharing → May require higher rating
- Social features → Review needed

---

## Final Recommendation

✅ **Select 4+ for App Store submission**
✅ **Answer questionnaire as documented above**
✅ **Add parental guidance note in description (optional)**
✅ **Review rating if features change**
