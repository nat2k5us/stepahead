# OAuth Configuration Complete ‚úÖ

Your iOS app is now fully configured for Google Sign-In with proper OAuth redirect handling.

## What Was Configured

### 1. **Info.plist - URL Scheme Registration**
Location: `ios/App/App/Info.plist`

Added `CFBundleURLTypes` to register the OAuth callback URL scheme:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>com.speechtherapy.app</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.734817707263-h0l9oflovbiuf09n3p1fpg178d86a76r</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

**What this does:**
- Registers your app to handle URLs with the `com.googleusercontent.apps...` scheme
- This is the `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` from your `GoogleService-Info.plist`
- When Google OAuth completes, it redirects to this URL scheme
- iOS opens your app and passes the auth token

### 2. **GoogleService-Info.plist - OAuth Credentials**
Location: `ios/App/App/GoogleService-Info.plist`

Contains the OAuth credentials from Firebase:
- ‚úÖ `CLIENT_ID` - Used by Firebase Auth SDK
- ‚úÖ `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` - Used as the URL scheme for callbacks
- ‚úÖ `API_KEY` - Firebase project API key

### 3. **AppDelegate.swift - URL Handling**
Location: `ios/App/App/AppDelegate.swift`

Already configured (by Capacitor) to handle OAuth callbacks:

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    return ApplicationDelegateProxy.shared.application(app, open: url, options: options)
}
```

### 4. **JavaScript - Firebase Auth Integration**
Location: `index.html`

- ‚úÖ iOS/Mobile detection: `isIOSorMobile()`
- ‚úÖ Redirect-based auth: `signInWithRedirect(auth, provider)`
- ‚úÖ Result handler: `getRedirectResult(auth)`
- ‚úÖ User state management after successful sign-in

## How OAuth Flow Works

### Desktop Browser Flow
1. User clicks "Google Sign-In"
2. Popup opens with Google OAuth page
3. User signs in with Google
4. Popup closes with auth result
5. App receives user data and signs them in

### iOS/Mobile Flow (What you configured)
1. User clicks "Google Sign-In"
2. iOS detects mobile/iOS environment
3. App redirects to Google OAuth in Safari
4. User signs in with Google
5. Google redirects to: `com.googleusercontent.apps.734817707263-h0l9oflovbiuf09n3p1fpg178d86a76r://callback`
6. iOS opens your app via URL scheme
7. AppDelegate receives the URL
8. Capacitor forwards to web layer
9. `getRedirectResult(auth)` catches the token
10. App extracts user data and signs them in

## Testing the Configuration

### Run the Verification Script
```bash
./deployment/verify-oauth-config.sh
```

This checks:
- GoogleService-Info.plist has OAuth credentials
- Info.plist has URL scheme registered
- AppDelegate has URL handling
- JavaScript has redirect auth implemented

Or run a quick check:
```bash
./deployment/verify-google-plist.sh
```

### Testing in Xcode

1. **Clean Build**
   - Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)

2. **Rebuild**
   - Product ‚Üí Build (Cmd+B)

3. **Run on Simulator**
   - Click the Play button or Cmd+R

4. **Test Google Sign-In**
   - Click the Google button in the login screen
   - Should see: "Redirecting to Google..."
   - Safari opens with Google OAuth page
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - **Callback happens**: App should reopen and sign you in

### Expected Console Logs

**When clicking Google button:**
```
üîµ Google Sign-In initiated
üìã Prerequisites: Enable Google provider in Firebase Console
üîó https://console.firebase.google.com ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
üîê Attempting Google sign in...
üì± Mobile/iOS detected - using redirect method for Google
üîÑ Calling signInWithRedirect...
‚úÖ Redirect initiated successfully
```

**After returning from Google (when app reopens):**
```
üîÑ Checking for OAuth redirect result...
‚úÖ Redirect sign-in successful: [user object]
üéâ Successfully signed in with google.com
üë§ User: [Your Name]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Operation not allowed"
**Cause**: Google Sign-In not enabled in Firebase Console
**Fix**:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
3. Enable Google, add support email, Save

### Issue: "Unauthorized domain"
**Cause**: App domain not in Firebase authorized domains
**Fix**:
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authorized domains
3. Add your domain or `localhost`

### Issue: Safari opens but doesn't return to app
**Possible causes:**
1. URL scheme not registered correctly (run `verify-oauth-config.sh`)
2. Capacitor not handling URL properly
3. Testing in iOS Simulator (try real device)

**Debug steps:**
- Check Xcode console for errors
- Verify URL scheme in Xcode: Project Settings ‚Üí Info ‚Üí URL Types
- Check if `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` matches between files

### Issue: "App opens but doesn't sign in"
**Cause**: `getRedirectResult` not being called
**Check**:
- Console logs should show "Checking for OAuth redirect result..."
- If you see errors, check Firebase Console for issues

## Firebase Console Setup Checklist

Before testing, ensure in Firebase Console:

- ‚úÖ Google Sign-In is enabled
- ‚úÖ Support email is set
- ‚úÖ iOS app is registered
- ‚úÖ Bundle ID matches: `com.speechtherapy.app`
- ‚úÖ `GoogleService-Info.plist` is downloaded and added to Xcode
- ‚úÖ Authorized domains include your testing domain

## Advanced: Testing on Real Device

For production/testing on real iOS devices:

1. **Connect iPhone via USB**
2. **Select device in Xcode** (top toolbar)
3. **Update signing** in project settings
4. **Build and Run** on device
5. **Test OAuth flow** (works better than simulator)

Real devices handle OAuth redirects more reliably than simulators.

## Production Deployment

When deploying to TestFlight/App Store:

1. ‚úÖ URL scheme is registered in Info.plist
2. ‚úÖ GoogleService-Info.plist is included in Xcode project
3. ‚úÖ Firebase Console has production domains authorized
4. ‚úÖ Privacy Policy and Terms links are added
5. ‚úÖ OAuth consent screen is configured in Google Cloud Console

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify all OAuth configuration
./deployment/verify-oauth-config.sh

# Quick check for Google OAuth credentials
./deployment/verify-google-plist.sh

# Check URL scheme registration
grep -A 20 "CFBundleURLTypes" ios/App/App/Info.plist

# Check REVERSED_CLIENT_ID
grep -A1 "REVERSED_CLIENT_ID" ios/App/App/GoogleService-Info.plist

# Sync changes to iOS
npx cap sync ios
```
